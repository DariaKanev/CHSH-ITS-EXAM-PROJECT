-### Learn In Public
-> If there’s a golden rule, it’s this one, so I put it first. All the other rules are more or less elaborations of this rule #1.  
-> A habit of creating learning exhaust:
->   - Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets.
->   - Speak at meetups and conferences.
->   - Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discord, they’re not public.
->   - Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams.
->   - Start a newsletter.
->   - Draw cartoons.    
-[Link](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)
-
-### Make Free Stuff
-
-> The best growth hack is still to build something people enjoy, then attaching no strings to it. You’d be surprised how far that can get you.  
-> Make free stuff! The web is still for everyone.  
-[Link](https://mxb.dev/blog/make-free-stuff/)
-
-### How to hone your new superpower: teaching
-
-> I learned early in my developer journey that teaching others is an effective way to quickly deepen my understanding of a new concept or technology. I’ve found that needing to articulate a particular concept to others causes me to revisit my assumptions and leads me to do additional research to fill any knowledge gaps.  
-[Link](https://github.com/readme/guides/public-documentation)
-
-### Your future self will thank you: Building your personal documentation.
-
-> Developers can take a DRY approach to how they search for answers to questions they encounter multiple times. By relying on an internal database (or “second brain”) they can reduce their reliance on external search engines.  
-[Link](https://github.com/readme/guides/private-documentation)
-
-### Brag now, remember later: Document your accomplishments
-
-> Given five minutes notice to summarize your recent professional and personal accomplishments and wins, how detailed would your response be? Would that be enough time for you to sufficiently capture some of the things you’re most proud of from the past few months or years?  
-[Link](https://github.com/readme/guides/document-success)
-
-
-### The most successful developers share more than they take
-> One of the questions I always ask successful bloggers is: what motivated you to start? The answer is always the same: I did it for myself. Whatever your work, you should embrace the philosophy of “public by default”.
-
-> Public-by-default means this: everytime you create something, learn something, or just notice something’s interesting, do it in public. This may seem daunting—writing blog posts, helping the community and transforming ideas from thoughts into words all takes time. But sharing is like a muscle, and by committing to a regular schedule, you become much more efficient. This consistency of volume is also key to reaping the benefits of sharing.
-
->To truly embrace public-by-default, it’s not enough to share your successful projects and knowledge, but additionally to bring the humility to share your learning and failures.

 Since, during the course, we explored the data about music bands, we decided to check if there is information about other types of musical organisations, more specifically orchestras. To do that we used [FRED](https://arco.istc.cnr.it/txt-amr-fred/) because this tool was originally used to create the MusicBo KG. Thanks to that we managed to discover the resource identifier for orchestras. 
 Then we launched the query to discover what kind of properties can be found with the resource identifier for orchestras as a subject or as an object. One of the first results we retrieved was the definition of an orchestra which we later used to create a text field in our [data story](https://melody-data.github.io/stories/published_stories/story_1687782595.724613.html) based on [MusicBo SPARQL endpoint](https://polifonia.disi.unibo.it/musicbo/sparql).

 Here we additionally used the already existing data story about the [MusicBo KG on Melody](https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/melody/musicbo/music_in_bologna_textual_corpus_overview) to see how different elements are encoded when MusicBo SPARQL endpoint is used. 
 Then we decided to count how many orchestras are mentioned in the MusicBo KG and presented it as a counter in our data story. 
 
 While exploring the list of properties used with the resource for orchestra we also discovered that there are orchestras mentioned in the connection with various cities so we organised the information about how many orchestras are connected with each of the cities.

 *Challenges* 
 
 While searching for orchestras connected with cities, we discovered that San Petronio, which is the name of the main basilica in Bologna is marked as a city. That means that the counter for orchestras mentioned with Bologna should have showed different number. Such a result must have been showed due to automatic extraction of the MusicBo KG.
 Another challenge that we faced related to the fact that querying the KG returned only three results of orchestras names. What’s more two of them definitely referred to the same orchestra name but with different spelling.

 We hypothesised that there must be more in the original corpus. In this regard we addressed the MusicBo corpus. During the investigation we encountered several problems with the search related to orchestras.

 Secondly, another problem we encountered was the inconsistency between the selected language (English) and the language of the obtained sentences. Despite setting the language to English, the first three sentences were in Italian. However, our research focused on investigating sentences exclusively in English.

 Finally, when attempting to view all 1383 sentences, we encountered another problem. Although we clicked on the "More+" option to display more sentences, only 430 of them were displayed. We attempted to increase the number of displayed sentences by adjusting the "N line", even setting it to 1000+, but this did not resolve the issue. To address this problem, we attempted to incrementally modify the query by clicking “+” and adding digits one by one, but this approach did not solve the problem.
