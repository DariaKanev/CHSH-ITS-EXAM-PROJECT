Ciao tutti! 

We are Daria Kaneva, Fidan Hajili and Elizaveta Britvenkova, 1st year students of the Master’s program “Language, Society and Communication” of the University of Bologna. Daria majores in English and French, Fidan – English and Spanish, Elizaveta – English and German. Due to the fact that our main field of studies has always been humanities, this project is our first ever coding experience, and we hope that it turned out well :) 

Let’s go!
