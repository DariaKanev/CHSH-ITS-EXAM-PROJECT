Our project focuses on developing data stories about orchestras and their historical and contemporary significance in the musical landscape. It exploreы Knowledge Graphs, specifically MusicBo and Wikidata. We aimed to extract data and present it as stories on the Melody website. We also used Polifonia corpus and tools like SPARQL and FRED. We encountered different types of problems during the investigation, but we tried to solve them.
